### License

1. What is the project's license?
In most repositories there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in
the root level of the repository. This is the one to examine. There may be
different licenses on specific files, but the project will have a main license.

   * Django doesn't have a main license such as GNU, instead it has it's own personalized license that simply states that their product is for free of use as long as you don't use/make modifications to their product for money-making purposes.

### Code Base


2. What is the primary programming language in the project?

    * The primary programming language of the project is Python.

<br>

3. What is the development environment? For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install?

   * The development environment simply consists of Python and any text editor. They suggest to use a text editor that is supported by EditorConfig.

database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries?

   * No, the project does not depend on any external addional software modules.

a judgment based on your random sample.

   * The code is indeed very simplistic and easy to understand. There are a wide range of comments in each source code file.

<br>

6. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/).

   * I would say that this project is a medium-sized projct. It may seem very large for a begginer, but in contrast to other Open Source projects, it isn't as big.

### Code and Design Documentation
8. Is there clear documentation in the code itself?

    * There is clear documentation in the code itself, however, the project does not contain as much documentation as I woudl like. There are files which contain multiple paragraphs and lines with detailed documentation of what the code below it is doing but there are also some files that do not contain any documentation at all. I believe there should be a heightened amount of this documentation in the files.

<br>


9. Is there documentation about the design?

    * There is documentation about the design. The philosophies Django's developers used in creating their framework include: "loose coupling, less code, don't repeat yourself (DRY), and explicit is better than implicit."

### Welcomeness and Community

24. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough.

    * There is a CONTRIBUTING document. It is extremely easy to read and understand. It is very clear and thorough; it gives a general overview of contributing to the project and even has a link in which individuals can go to which lead to sections, such as, advice for first-time contributors and how to make specific contributions (reporting bugs, writing code, etc).

<br>

25. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violte it?

    * There is a CODE OF CONDUCT page that individuals are able to go to. Django emphasizes ways in which users and contributors should conduct themselves within the community, whilst listing forms of behavior that deemed as unacceptable. However, Django does not state the consequences for acts that violate it; they simply have an email in which individuals can reach out to if they believe an individual is violating the Code of Conduct.

    * Yes, the maintainers thank people for their contributions.

<br>

### Summary
Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the
course of a semester?

   * Yes, this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the course of a semester. From the research we have done, it is evident that there is an active and welcoming community. There are numerous commits, issues, and pull requests. It is apparent that the community works daily to make progress on the progress. However, we feel that the project is slightly more difficult for beginners to work on and it tracks issues on the Django Project website, instead of Github, which makes it slightly more confusing to those who are new to the project. Overall though, it is possible to contribute to this project over the course of a semester.

### Installation

Install the project on your local machines following the instructions from the project and report on whether they were successful and try to resolve any issues.

   * I installed the project, Django, on my local machine (my MacOS), following the instructions from the project. I was successful! I had an issue where a message kept appearing in terminal stating that it needs ssl modules and my machine does not have any. However, in order to solve this issue, I took to Google and learned that I just needed to reinstall python. After the reinstallation, I was able to successfully install Django. There are four steps and they can be followed directly from Django's webpage "How to install Django/Install the Django code"; I followed the "Installing the development version" from the page. It is important that an individual read over each of these steps thoroughly. The installation is quick and easy if the directions are followed carefully.
