### License

1. What is the project's license?
In most repositories there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in
the root level of the repository. This is the one to examine. There may be
different licenses on specific files, but the project will have a main license.  
**Django doesn't have a main license such as GNU, instead it has it's own personalized license that simply states that their product is for free of use as long as you don't use/make modifications to their product for money-making purposes.**

### Summary
Do you think this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the
course of a semester?

**Yes, this is a project in which it would very much be possible to contribute to during the course of the semester. From what I have seen throughout this evaluation process of the Django project, the community is both very friendly and active. There's a good amount of issues that a contributor can start working on, and they can confidently contribute to the project knowing that there is a high chance that their contributions will be merged and published as pull requests are merged frequently. The Django community is also very helpful in giving suggestions and constructive criticism in issue discussions, which tends to help out the people that are contributing to the project. The only real negative criticism that I can give to the Django project is that the project doesn't seem like such a great project to start contributing to for new up and coming contributors. The project does seem like it's more for experienced contributors that have been part of the Open Source world for a while since the project doesn't have many issues that are made/marked for beginners. Nevertheless, it is possible to contribute to this project over the course of the semester.**

### Installation Process Report:
**The installation process for me took about a little more than hour, but it was ultimately successful. Django has great resources on how to setup the development environment/version of Django. I followed the instructions at these links to install the dev version of Django: [first link](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/install/) and the [second link](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/contributing/). The process was not at all hard due to Djando's great documentation!**
