### License

1. What is the project's license?
In most repositories there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in
the root level of the repository. This is the one to examine. There may be
different licenses on specific files, but the project will have a main license.  
* The project's license grants the user with the right:
* to use the product royalty-free
* the user is allowed to make, user, offer, sell, and import
* The user is not allowed  to use the trade names or trademarks

<br>

### Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?  
* The primary programming language in the project  is JavaScript.
<br>


2. What is the development environment? For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install?  
* This is developed primarily using javascript to be run on Internet Explorer 10 and 11, Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
<br>

3. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries?  
* This is a web based software, where users users blocks of code to build larger programs. This does rely on base web features, but nothing more.
<br>

4. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample.  
* Most of the files that were browsed appear to have some good comments that made them understandable even if a user didn't know what the code was doing. However there were files, mostly the shorter code files, that didn't have any sort of comments which made those codes hard to understand because even though the files were short they had functions that were used in other code files.
<br>

5. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/).  
* This project has about 144,354 lines of code which makes this project  relatively small as compared to other projects out there.
<br>


6. Does the repository have tests?  
* Yes, this project has a folder of tests to run.
<br>

### Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself?  
* Most of the files that were browsed appear to have some good comments that made each function easy to understand which is very beneficial for those looking to  contribute to a project. However there were some files present that had no comments, mostly the shorter ones, that made it hard to understand the code because it was unknown what that code was supposed to be for until the user thoroughly read the code.
<br>


2. Is there documentation about the design?  
* Yes, the project contains files regarding the design
<br>

### Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week?  
* No commits have been made in the past week to the master branch but 14 commits have been made to all branches.
<br>

2. When was the most recent commit?  
* The most recent commit was on Febuary 3.
<br>

3. How many issues are currently open?  
* Currently there are 405 issues open.
<br>

4. How long do issues stay open?  
Take the five most recently closed issues and look at when each was first reported.  
Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.  
  1. Opened 8 days ago -- closed 2 days ago -- total of 7 days
  2. Opened 3 days ago -- closed 2 days ago -- total of 2 days
  3. Opened 5 days ago -- closed 3 days ago -- total of 3 days
  4. opened 22 days ago -- closed 3 days ago -- total of 20 days
  5. Opened 4 days ago -- closed 3 days ago -- total of 2 day  
* (7+2+3+20+2)/5 = 34 days total / 6.8 = **6.8 days open on average**  

<br>

5. Is there active discussion on the issues?  
Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues.  
* Conversations are fairly scarce in the open issues. On the other hand, in the closed issues, if the issue could not be immediately
solved, then active discussions would take place to either understand the problem or flesh out what exactly needs to be fixed. But the observable majority of conversations have 1 or no comments.
<br>

6. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.?  
The issues are not tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, or anything of the sort.
<br>

7. How many issues were closed in the past six months?  
* 292 issues were closed in the past six months
<br>


8. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project?  
* No, there is no clear indication how many people are maintaining the project.
<br>

9. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months?  
* 127 people have contributed in the last 6 months.
<br>


10. How many open pull requests are there?  
* There are currently 27 open pull requests.
<br>

11. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time?
Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
Take the five most recently closed ones and look at when each was first reported.
Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.  
   1. Opened 4 days ago and closed 3 days ago. Total of 2 days
   2. Opened 5 days ago and closed 5 days ago. Total of 1 day
   3. Opened 6 days ago and closed 6 days ago. Total of 1 day
   4. Opened 7 days ago and closed 6 days ago. Total of 2 days
   5. Opened 9 days ago and closed 6 days ago. Total of 4 days
   * [2+1+1+2+4] = 10 days total / 5 = 2 days average open, which shows that pull request do not remained unanswered for long
<br>

12. Is there active discussion on the pull requests?
Use the same method as you did for the issues.  
* The merged pull requests have very little conversation (with the exception of very few pull requests), but these were also approved for merging within a few days. The open pull requests have much more conversation. Interestingly, a maintainer has decided to keep some pull requests open as a reference for other users. One open request is an enhancement for the blockly system that differs from the original implementation. Instead of rejecting or closing the issue, the maintainer decided to mark it as an optimization and leave it open for others.
<br>

13. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months?  
* 386 pull requests were opened in the last 6 months, but only 8 are still open.
<br>


14. When was the last  pull request  merged?   
* The last pull request was merged February 27.
<br>

### Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough.  
* Blockly does include a CONTRIBUTING document and it is short and easy to understand.
<br>

2. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violte it?
* There is **no** code of conduct.
<br>

3. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive?
Read the issue conversations.  
* There are several maintainers that repeatedly respond to issues and provide help by either reproducing the problems found and try to form a solution.
<br>

4. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?  
* Yes, for the most part people appear to be pretty nice and helpful.
<br>

5. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?  
* Maintainers don't seem to thank people for their contributions but they do handle the problems.
<br>

### Summary
Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the
course of a semester?  
* The level this project requires seems to be attainable for me. I wouldn't be opposed to work on this project, and of the ones I've seen so far, this does seem the most interesting of the bunch. So in summary, I do think this is a project that would be possible to contribute to the entire semester.
