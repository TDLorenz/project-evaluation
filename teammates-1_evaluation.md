### Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project? <br>[**Java**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) is the main programming language.

1. What is the development environment? For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux? Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? <br>As GNOME Clocks is primarily written in Vala, which gets compiled down to C (instead of machine language) and then compiled for local use with a C compiler, contributing would involve a couple of ingredients. These are the: Vala compiler, C compiler (default gcc), pkg-config (tool to pass library information to the C compiler), C standard library (typically glibc), and Glib2 library. There do not appear to be any clear instructions for how to download, build and install.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? <br>Yes, the project does have some software module dependencies, a list of which can be found [here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-clocks/-/blob/master/meson.build). The project's [HACKME](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-clocks/-/blob/master/HACKME) document provides a [link](http://www.valadoc.org/) to documentation for these libraries. The HACKME also points to an [article](https://blogs.gnome.org/tvb/2013/05/29/composite-templates-lands-in-vala/), which gives some indication of how a developer will work with UI templates.

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
Vala is a C-like language (perhaps unsurprising given that it compiles down to C) and is therefore fairly straightforward to read; thus the same can be said for the GNOME Clocks code. There are higher-level OOP concepts at play and this does detract from some clear readability, but as with any codebase, understanding comes with sufficient time.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>According to OpenHub, GNOME Clocks consists of approximately six thousand lines of code and would therefore be considered a small project in the world of software development by that metric. While the project has over 250 contributors in total, work on it appears to be largely limited to a few developers. 

1. Does the repository have tests?<br>While there are a couple of tests for the UI, there do not appear to be any unit tests for the balance of the code.

### Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself?<br>Comments are sparse in the [src](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-clocks/-/tree/master/src) directory, but used in necessity to point out FIXME's, TODO's, translator notes, and steps in complicated functions. 
Some files are much more well documented than others, such as [alarm.vala](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-clocks/-/blob/master/src/alarm.vala). Also, the functions and variables in the code are very clear and purposeful, helping hint at what is going on.

1. Is there documentation about the design?<br>There is a [design page](https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Clock#Objectives) that mentions the objectives of the app, however the rest of the page mainly contains mockups and wireframes of the app's frontend design. The GitLab repo doesn't seem to contain anything mentioning the code/directory structure or functional components of the project either.

### Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week?<br><b>23</b> commits have been made within the last week. 

1. When was the most recent commit?<br>The most recent commit was authored 10 minutes ago. It was <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-clocks/-/commit/e6465df5bd55006a2c3b75445eae8b725edcf74b">Update Turkish translation</a>.

1. How many issues are currently open?<br>There are <b>28</b> open issues as of now.

1. How long do issues stay open? 
Take the five most recently closed issues and look at when each was first reported. Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.<br>291 + 406 + 270 + 80 + 0<br>Average number of days an issue stays open based off of the last 5 closed issues: <b>209</b> days

1. Is there active discussion on the issues?
Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues.<br>Yes, there is active discussion on the issues.

1. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.?<br>The issues are not tagged on their difficulty level. The tags I see are: Out of Scope, Feature, Crash, Bug, Translation, Needs Information, or Not Actionable. The "Out of Scope" and "Not Actionable" issues could be argued as high difficulty, however, there aren't issues that are tagged as easy or for beginners.

1. How many issues were closed in the past six months?<br>Within the last six months, <b>33</b> issues were closed.

1. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project?<br>There are **2** maintainers for this project.

1. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months?<br>**286** authors staged <b>1924</b> commits within the last 10 months.

1. How many open pull requests are there?<br>There is currently <b>one</b> open merge request.

1. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
Take the five most recently closed ones and look at when each was first reported.
Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.<br>65 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 202 <br>The average number of days pull requests stay open is <b>53</b> days.

1. Is there active discussion on the pull requests? Use the same method as you did for the issues.<br>Yes, there is active discussion on the pull requests.

1. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months?<br>There were **44** pull requests opened within the past six months.

1. When was the last  pull request  merged?<br>The last pull request was merged <b>one</b> hour ago.

### Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it? Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough.<br>There isn't a CONTRIBUTING file, but instead a [HACKME](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-clocks/-/blob/master/HACKME) made to help new developers. It provides information and links for providing a good patch, working with the Vala programming language, and using their style enforcer, [Coala](https://github.com/coala/coala). The file is friendly and helpful, but not super thorough.

1. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that violate it?<br>No CODE OF CONDUCT document exists.

1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues? Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations.<br>Based off of the issue conversations, the community seems very understanding and knowledgable. I saw that a couple of people are really thankful for some issues being opened by the community. Also, if somebody is confused, then they would ask for clarification. If there is an unaddressed problem, then the community would explain what the issue is in great detail.

1. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?<br>Yes, the people thank others for their contributions. If somebody asks a question, then others in the community are willing to answer without hesitation. If somebody is confused, then they would say "Can you please elaborate...?".

1. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?<br>
Yes, they do! As previously mentioned, the maintainers thanked the community when opening up very useful issues.

### Summary
Do you think this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the course of a semester?

This project is fairly active with a great community. But, honestly speaking, it really depends on how motivated the person is, and how dedicated that person is to learn a new language throughout the course of the semester. GNOME Clocks is 86.7% Vala, which is a heavy object-oriented programming language similar to C. Since it is a heavy OOP language, they would have to do deal with the hassle of constantly referring back to other classes of code and trying to comprehend each section of the hierarchy. If they are up for the challenge, that's great. If they already know Vala, even better. However, as much as learning new languages, tools, and technologies is a great thing, we all agree that it would be best to start off with a project that has familiar technologies.
