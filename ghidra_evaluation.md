### License

1. *What is the project's license?
In most repositories there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in
the root level of the repository. This is the one to examine. There may be
different licenses on specific files, but the project will have a main license.*
    **The project has an Apache license 2.0. Specifically it has a permissive license.**

### Code Base

1. *What is the primary programming language in the project?*
    **The primary language is Java.**
1. *What is the development environment? For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install?*
    **In order to start developing extensions and scripts you would still have to install GhidraDev plugin for Eclipse. This plugin is easily downloadable from their homepage. The website is https://www.ghidra-sre.org/.**
1. *Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries?*
    **Other than the distribution package that it provides on their website https://www.ghidra-sre.org/.   It can be typically run on user-interactive and automated modes.**
1. *Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample.*
    **Based on random sampling, we think the code is fairly easy to understand. The random sample that I picked was written in bash, which I’ve had some previous experience in from a previous class.**
1. *Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/).*
    **This is a huge project. The closest approximation is more than 2,800k and less than 3,000k lines of code.**
1. *Does the repository have tests?*
    **Yes, it has a few sample tests for their extensions, plugins, as well as other scripts.**

### Code and Design Documentation
1. *Is there clear documentation in the code itself?*
    **There is some documentations of different components ,of the project itself, in different readme’s. But it’s very disorganized and often hard to digest.**
1. *Is there documentation about the design?*
    **There is some documentation about the framework of the project, in different folders, but it is barely any. Most of the documentation is on the code itself if any code is documented.**

### Welcomeness and Community

1. *Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it? Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough.*
    **The CONTRIBUTING document is _extremely_ clear and concise. It opens the document by listing ways the community can contribute to the project and separates the remaining information in the sections:**  
    * **Bugs and Feature Requests**
    * **Patch Submission tips**
    * **Review**
    * **Getting Started**
    * **Timeline and Managing Expectations**
    * **Legal**
    **The document is well organized and presented using basic language. This allows people with any git knowledge to easily understand the document.**
1. *Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violte it?*
    **No, there is no CODE OF CONDUCT document in this repository.**
1. *Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues? Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations.*
    **Maintainers seem to respond quickly and clearly to questions. In the long conversations, once a maintainer understood the issues and was able to replicate the problem (_if neccessary_), a thorough explanation was given. Maintainers typically explained why the problem occurred and what the steps are to fix it. In short conversations, the issues were quickly resolved and required little clarification.**  
    **Comments in issues were all either leading to more discussion or thankful.**
1. *Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?*
    **People are professional and friendly in the issues. In one particular issue (_ titled: NullPointer Exception when running any Pything script #1513_), the author admitted they were "afraid to admit it for fear of ridicule, but I do not know how to do that [debugging and specific commands in Java]. The collaborator responded positively saying not to worry since many of their contributors do not know Java.**
1. *Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?*
    **Maintainers do not thank people in merge and pull requests. Typically in the shorter Issues maintainers also do not thank people, but occasionally in the longer ones, they will essentially say "_you're welcome_". Very rarely do they thank someone for presenting an issue.**

### Summary
*Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute in the
course of a semester?*

**We do not think this is a project we would **want** to contribute to throughout the semester. Although the community seems pleasant, the lack of a Code of Conduct is a red flag. Absence of etiquette standards may create an unwelcoming environment because of unintentional assumptions and actions of participants and the maintainers.  Moreover, the issues are not tagged by difficulty. Therefore, finding an issue to work on is almost a blind pick. Without reading through and attempting a plethora of issues, a new contributor would have difficulty working on an issue appropriate for their level. Another issue we have with this project is 86% of the code is in Java, which is a language we are not familiar with. Our contributions would likely be negligible or insufficient considering our skill level.**
