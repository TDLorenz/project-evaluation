### Installation
  **The project took a little over an hour to install thanks to Zulip's "Development environment installation" documentation. The documentation goes step by step starting with requirements and prerequisites. The documentation provides different installation procedures depending on your operating system. After each step is completed the documentation lets you know what a successful output looks on your terminal and on your browser. Once you determine you were successful in each step, the documentation directs you to your new step. Most steps included issues you may run into and how to fix those issues.**
